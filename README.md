# number-guessing-game
**Task:** Make a number guessing game on a webpage. The webpage randomizes a number and the user tries to guess the number by inputting it in a text field. The webpage should tell if the correct number is bigger or smaller than the one guessed. A new number is randomized when the user finds the correct number.
